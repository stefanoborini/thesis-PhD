\caption{\footnotesize One of the possible final code layouts, involving
direct changes in the code. An integral producer, such as \texttt{MOLCAS}, provides
proprietary files. These files are fed to a converter, which creates the new
Q5Cost format. The program \texttt{CASDI} from Toulouse directly reads these
files. This infrastructure at the moment is not possible, because the
current \texttt{CASDI} implementation reads the old COST format.}
