\caption{\footnotesize The incorrect behavior of the 2A$_1$ (cross symbol)
and 3A$_1$ (star symbol) Rydberg states at QD-NEVPT level, with respect to
the elongation of the CO bond. A grid step of 0.01 bohr between 2.7 and 2.9
bohr has been used.
Between the curves the plot also depicts the CASSCF avoided crossing taking
place at the same bond length. The avoided crossing curves have been
transposed to better fit into the plot. } \label{fig:qdpt_error}
