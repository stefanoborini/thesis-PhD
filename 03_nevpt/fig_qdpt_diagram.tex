\caption{\footnotesize The computational scheme for the evaluation of the
Quasi Degenerate treatment. Four different QDPT matrixes are obtained by the
procedure, each one referring to a particular state. A single column is
extracted from each matrix and gathered in a final matrix which is
diagonalized. }
