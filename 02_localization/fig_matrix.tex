\caption{\footnotesize A visual representation of large (ORTORBL) and small (ORTORBS)
molecular orbitals matrices. Localized orbitals are first classified as frozen or
non-frozen. The non-frozen orbitals are supposed to have negligible
coefficients on distant atoms. These coefficients are strictly set to
zero by the cut procedure, and a localized optimization is performed in the
obtained AO/MO subspace. }
