\caption{\footnotesize A visual representation of the hierarchical
orthonormalization performed on the orbitals. The non-frozen orbitals
(marked with ``1'' in figure) are orthonormalized among themselves.
Then, frozen core orbitals (marked with ``2'' in figure) are orthonormalized
among themselves and against the non-frozen ones. Finally, the frozen
virtual orbitals (marked with ``3'') are orthonormalized against ``1'' and ``2''.
