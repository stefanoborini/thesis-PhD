\caption{\footnotesize A comparison of the CAS+S energy curves between the zwitterionic
(7Z)-13 ammoniotridec-7-enoate (solid line) and the (6Z)-dodec-6-ene, a
molecule obtained by replacing the charged NH$_{3}$ and COO$^{-}$ groups
with hydrogen atoms, dashed line.  A common zero in the energy scale of the
plot has been obtained taking the trans form as zero of the energy.  }
